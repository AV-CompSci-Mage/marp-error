# 2 meetings every week Tuesday and Thursday

* Early CST - Early risers and Eastern timezones

* Evening CST - Western timezones (and really late Eastern folks)

* Calendar contains zoom links

* Attend 10 sessions for credit, attendence via google form.

---

# Format

* 3 practice problems every session

* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after class

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the code playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

# <!-- fit --> Using interfaces

---

* Interfaces are like a set of rules for your class to follow.

* A list of functions and variables that a class has to implement.

* It doesn't give the functionality - unlike inheritance with `class`

* The goal is to create a way of making people implement common functionality.

# Problem (10 minutes)

* Implement a the `Comparable` interface for the class `Student` to compare students on credit hours.

* Credit hours should be a instance variable of type `int[]` like `{3, 3, 4, 1, 3}`

* Don't forget `@Override`

* Use `assert` for making sure the other type is a `Student`

---

```java
public class Student implements Comparable {
  private int[] creditHours;
  public Student(int[] setHours) {
    creditHours = setHours;
  }
}

var s1 = new Student(new int[]{1, 1, 1});
var s2 = new Student(new int[]{4});
assert (s2.compareTo(s1) > 0);
```

```java

    assert o instanceof Student;
    var ownGrades = 0;
    for (var hours: creditHours) {
      ownGrades += hours;
    }
    
    Student other = (Student) o;
    var otherGrades = 0;
    for (var hours: other.creditHours) {
      otherGrades += hours;
    }
    if (ownGrades > otherGrades) {
      return 1;
    } else if (ownGrades == otherGrades) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }
