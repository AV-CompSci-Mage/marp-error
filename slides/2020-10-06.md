# <!-- fit --> CS 199 EMP

## <!-- fit --> Even More Practice

---

# 2 meetings every week Tuesday and Thursday

* Early CST - Early risers and Eastern timezones

* Evening CST - Western timezones (and really late Eastern folks)

* Calendar contains zoom links

* Attend 10 ones for credit. 

---

# Format

* 3 practice problems every session

* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after class

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the code playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

---

# <!-- fit --> Polymorphism Casting

---

```java
public class Book { }
public class Fiction extends Book { }
public class Romance extends Fiction { } 
```

* Up casting is *going up* the inheritance chain. 

* `Romance` can be cast up to `Fiction`, `Book`, `Object`. `Fiction` can be cast up to `Book` and `Object`

* Everything can basically be cast into an `Object` since everything inherits from that

---

* Upcasting will always work without any errors (no need for if conditions or anything)

* You lose out on the all the variables and methods from the cast you convert from. For example going from `Fiction` to `Book` you will still have access to all of Book's variables and methods, but not the ones that exist in `Fiction` that don't exist in `Book`

```java
Romance prideAndPrejudice = new Romance();
Fiction f = prideAndPrejudice; // Upcast Romance -> Fiction
Object o = f; // Upcast Fiction -> Book
```

---

* Downcasting is the opposite, *going down* the inheritance chain.

* May cause errors so make sure to use `varibale instanceof Class` to be sure it works.

* Doing this gives access to variables
