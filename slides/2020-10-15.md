# References

* ***Reference equality:*** If two references refer to the same object, they are equal
  * "==", ".equals()"
* ***Object equality***
  * Class-defined equality, usually based on field values
  * ".equals()"

---

# Pass by value vs reference
* by value: a ***copy*** of the variable will be pased into the method
* by reference: the method will be working with the ***original*** variable

# Abstract Classes
* you *can* inherit from an abstract class
* you *cannot* create an instane of it
* Abstract classes provide methods for the class to use
* If any of your methods are marked abstract, you must make the class ```abstract```

---
# Interfaces
* an **Interface** is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information
* Interfaces have to be implemented by a specific class, they can't function on their own, using the keyword ```implements```.
* You also have to implement **all the methods the interface declares**.

---

# Interface vs. Inheritance

* Only one inheritance per class
  * different classes could have different functionalities
  * Java can't decide which implementation to use

* Multiple interfaces is allowed
  * Interface just says what the class is doing, not how it's doing it
  * We define the class functionality!

---

# Problem 1: Lets implement an interface!

allow me to start it off for you, but from here, you should create a class that implements the following interface I made (I tried to get creative, you can too!)

```Java
interface Monster {
  // interface methods (do not have bodies)

  public void didTheMash();    // it was a graveyard smash
  public void playedTheMash(); // it caught on in a flash
}
```

---

# Problem 2: remember me?
Create a public class named ```Minimum``` with a single class method named ```min```. ```min``` should take in an array of Objects that implement Comparable and return the smallest value in the array. Don't forget your null checks!

---
# Problem 3: practice with arrays
Write a function that given an integer, creates a 2D `char` array that, when called with printGrid, prints this pattern:

for $x = 1,2, 3, 4, 5$

```
x   xx    x o x     x o o x     x o o o x
    xx    o x o     o x x o     o x o x o
          x o x     o x x o     o o x o o
                    x o o x     o x o x o
                                x o x o x
```

# Weekly recap
* Remaining time is for you to ask questions about literally anything the class has covered so far!
* Don't hesitate :)

Problem 1

```java
public class Mon implements Monster {
  public String name;
  public Mon(String setName) {
    name = setName;
  }
  public void didTheMash() {
    System.out.println(name + " did the monster mash");
  }
  public void playedTheMash() {
    System.out.println(name + " was caught in on a flash!");
  }
}
```


---
Problem 2

```Java
public class Minimum {
  public static Comparable min(Comparable[] arr) {
    if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) {
      return null;
    }
    
    Comparable temp = arr[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i].compareTo(temp) < 0) {
        temp = arr[i];
      }
    }
    return temp;
  }
}
```

Problem 3

```java
public static String[][] xtremeVDay(int n) {
  String[][] returnArr = new String[n][n];
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (i == j || (i + j) == n - 1) {
        returnArr[i][j] = "x";
      } else {
        returnArr[i][j] = "o";
      }
    }
  }
  return returnArr;
}
```
