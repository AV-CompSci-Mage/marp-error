# 2 meetings every week Tuesday and Thursday

* Early CST - Early risers and Eastern timezones

* Evening CST - Western timezones (and really late Eastern folks)

* Calendar contains zoom links

* Attend 10 sessions for credit, attendence via google form.

---

# Format

* 3 practice problems every session

* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after class

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the code playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

# <!-- fit --> Libraries and Imports

---

# Libraries

* Libraries are code other people write that you can use

* Programs are shorter and easier to read.

* They are also well tested so you don't have to worry as much about bugs.

* We use `import name.of.package`

---

# `import`

```java
import java.util.Date;

var date = new Date();
System.out.println(date);
// print today's date and time
```

---

# Documentation

* to understand what a library is doing we use documentation and web search

* For example for the last slide we can use [Official Javadoc for Date](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Date.html)

* It's often helpful to look for example code of usage of the library and trying out simple examples first

---

# External vs Java Standard Library

* Java itself has an extensive library written by the language creators. To import them all you need to do is `import java.whatever` 

* External libraries are more complicated since you need to install them on your system. After that the import will look something like `import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;`

---

# Problem (10 minutes)

* Import a class `UUID` from `java.util`. UUID is a form of unique id

* Reading the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html) and other online sources to create a single UUID and print it out on the screen.

* No starter code but also don't overthink it. This should be 3-4 lines of code.

# <!-- fit --> Type Inference

* Type inference is Java compiler smartly understanding data types without having to specify it.
