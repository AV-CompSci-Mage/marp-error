# 2 meetings every week Tuesday and Thursday

* Early CST - Early risers and Eastern timezones

* Evening CST - Western timezones (and really late Eastern folks)

* Calendar contains zoom links

* Attend 10 sessions for credit, attendence via google form.

---

# Format

* 3 practice problems every session

* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after class

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the code playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

# <!-- fit --> ArrayList

# ArrayList 

* Here we implement `List` by just using an `Array` on the inside.

* Which works great since we can just implement almost all our functionality just using what arrays can already do

* `get(i)` is just `array[i]`

* `set(i, element)` is just `array[i] = element`

* `size()` is just `array.length`

---

# Array List resize

* Resizing gets more complicated 

* When you add elements you have to resize a new array which is larger and copy everything over.

* a) Copy everything as is till the index you want to insert at b

* b) At the index insert it in

* c) After that resume copying (make sure to account for offsets)

* For reference: Look at the `ArrayList` homework.

---

# Problem (10 minutes)

* ArrayList `int delete(int index)`

* The return value will be what you deleted.

* The size should reduce by one

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
public class ArrayList {
  int[] array;
  public ArrayList(int[] setArray) {
    array = setArray;
  }
  public int delete(int index) {
    return 0; // TODO
  }
  public int size() {
    return 0; // TODO
  }
}
var l = new ArrayList(new int[]{10, 25, 35});
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(l.array)); // should be [10, 35]
assert l.delete(1) == 25;
assert l.size() == 2;
```
