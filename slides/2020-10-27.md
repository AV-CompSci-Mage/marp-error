# <!-- fit --> Attendance Link:

---

# 2 meetings every week Tuesday and Thursday

* Early CST - Early risers and Eastern timezones

* Evening CST - Western timezones (and really late Eastern folks)

* Calendar contains zoom links

* Attend 10 sessions for credit, attendence via google form.

---

# Format

* 3 practice problems every session

* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after both sessions

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the code playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

# <!-- fit --> ArrayList

---

# ArrayList 

* Here we implement `List` by just using an `Array` on the inside.

* Which works great since we can just implement almost all our functionality just using what arrays can already do

* `get(i)` is just `array[i]` - $O(1)$

* `set(i, element)` is just `array[i] = element` - $O(1)$

* `size()` is just `array.length` - $O(1)$

* For specific code refer to the 125 lectures.

---

# Array List add resize

* Resizing gets more complicated 

* When you add elements you have to resize a new array which is larger and copy everything over.

* a) Copy everything as is till the index you want to insert at b

* b) At the index insert it in

* c) After that resume copying (make sure to account for offsets)

* For reference: Look at the `ArrayList` homework.

* Due to the loops this has the complexity $O(n)$

---

# Problem (10 minutes)

* ArrayList `int delete(int index)`

* The return value will be what you deleted.

* The size should reduce by one

* Also comment on the $big O$ time nature of your solution. 

---

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
public class ArrayList {
  int[] array;
  public ArrayList(int[] setArray) {
    array = setArray;
  }
  public int delete(int index) {
    return 0; // TODO
  }
  public int size() {
    return 0; // TODO
  }
}
var l = new ArrayList(new int[]{10, 25, 35});
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(l.array)); // should be [10, 35]
assert l.delete(1) == 25;
assert l.size() == 2;
```

# <!-- fit --> LinkedList

---

# LinkedList

* A list that is connected by different elements that link to each other.

* `'a' -> 'b' -> 'd' -> 'c' -> 'e' -> null` 

* We just have to store the `start` point and know how to go to the `next` point. 

* To do anything we always need to start at `start` and then traverse till we find the node we're looking for.

* `get(i)` - go through the elements till you get to element `i` - $O(n)$

* `set(i, value)` - go through the elements till you get to element `i` and then set that. - $O(n)$

* `size()` - go through all elements while incrementing a counter - $O(n)$

* Alternatively you can implement a variable to store `length` as well to make `size()` $O(1)$ but then you increase the storage space. This is fine in _most_ cases

---

# LinkedList resize add

* In the last slide, it seems that linked lists are basically awful. Why even use them?

* It makes adding and resizing pretty fine. ArrayLists you have to constantly copy over and create new arrays when things are added.

* `add(i, value)` - go through elements till you get to the one you want then create a new `Node` with the old `next` as the `next` of that Node. The previous `next` will become linked to the new `Node`

* This is can be $O(n)$ because even if the addition is $O(1)$, the time to find that node can still take $O(n)$

* But in some special cases, adding can be $O(1)$ like if you add to the `start`.

* If you store a variable for the `end` of the list then you can do $O(1)$ addition there. 

* Adding to the start and end is the most common when adding items to the list, so these special cases make it quite worthwhile. 

---

# Problem (10 minutes)

* LinkedList `int delete(int index)`

* Similar to the ArrayList problem from earlier.

* The return value will be what you deleted.

* The size should reduce by one

* Also comment on the $big O$ time nature of your solution.

```java
public class LinkedList {
  Node start;
  Node end;
  class Node {
    int value;
    Node next;
    Node(int setValue, Node setNext) {
      value = setValue;
      next = setNext;
    }
  }
  public int delete(int i) {
    return 0; // implement
  }
  public void addBack(int o) { }
  public String toString() { }
}
var l = new LinkedList();
l.addBack(1);
l.addBack(5);
l.addBack(3);
l.delete(1);
System.out.println(l); // 1 -> 3 ->
```

---

For debugging add this to your code

```java
  public void addBack(int o) {
    if (start == null) {
      start = new Node(o, null);
      end = start;
    } else {
      var prevEnd = end;
      var newEnd = new Node(o, null);
      prevEnd.next = newEnd;
      end = newEnd;
    }
  }
  public String toString() {
    var str = "";
    Node current = start;
    while (current != null) {
      str = str + current.value + " -> ";
      current = current.next;
    }
    return str;
  }
```
