# ArrayList 

* Here we implement `List` by just using an `Array` on the inside.

* Which works great since we can just implement almost all our functionality just using what arrays can already do

* `get(i)` is just `array[i]`

* `set(i, element)` is just `array[i] = element`

* `size()` is just `array.length`
