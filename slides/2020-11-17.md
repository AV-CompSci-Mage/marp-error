* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after both sessions

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the code playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

# <!-- fit --> Recursion

# Recursive fibonacci Problem (10 minutes)

A classic problem used everywhere when teaching recursion.

For the first two,

$fib_0 = 1$

$fib_1 = 1$

Otherwise

$fib_n = fib_{n-1} + fib_{n-2}$

Recursively generate fibonacci numbers using recursion.

```java
long fib(int n) {
    return 0; 
}
```

# <!-- fit --> Binary Trees

---

# Problem (10 minutes)

* Check for full binary tree

* That means that each node has either zero children, or two.

* Return `true` for null cases.

# Problem (10 minutes)

* Given a binary tree, check if it follows the heap property.

* There are many types of heaps, here we pick max-heap nodes higher up are greater than the ones below.

* Return `true` if all the childen below a node are less than the given node.
