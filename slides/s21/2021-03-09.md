# Upcasting and Downcasting Revisited 

Think of climbing a ladder. The top of the ladder is the `Object` class.
Upcasting = going *up* the ladder
- super easy to do and always possible, but you lose the methods and variables in the original class 

Downcasting = going *down* the ladder
- more complicated because you must check if instance of using `instanceof` 

---

# Upcasting and Downcasting Example

```java
class Movie {
  private int generalRating; 
  public int getGeneralRating() {
    return generalRating; 
  }
}

class Romance extends Movie { 
  private int cheesyRating; 
  public int getcheesyRating() {
    return cheesyRating;
  }
  
}

Movie twilight = new Romance(); // upcasting example 
twilight.getcheesyRating(); // will this run?
twilight.getGeneralRating(); // will this run? 

```

# Practice with Upcasting and Downcasting (5 minutes)

Use the Movie class from the previous slide.

(1) What's another class that could descend from Movie? What's a unique method it would have?  

(2) Create an Movie object that is an instance of the child class you came up with in (1). 

(3) Properly downcast the Movie object from (2) into an instance of your child class and have it call the unique function you came up with in (1).

---

# Practice with Upcasting and Downcasting (10 minutes)

Create a method called `vetVisit()` that accepts a single Pet parameter and returns a `String` that is the type of visit. Depending on what kind of pet is passed in, the vet visit will change. You can assume that all Pets have a method called `isRegular()` which returns a boolean value indicating whether the pet is a regular. If the `Pet` is null or not one of the described ones, you should return null.

- If the pet is a `Dog` and a regular, the visit will be a "Regular Grooming". If the pet is a `Dog` but not a regular, the visit will be a "Parasite Prevention Session". 

- If the pet is a `Cat`, the visit will be a "Cat Wellness Exam".

- If the pet is a `Hamster`, the visit will be a "Dental Care Visit".

# References - The Analogy 

House: Reference :: Object: Reference 
Phone: Phone Number :: Object: Reference 
Student: UID :: Object: Reference 

A new object is created with the `new` keyword. Variables store references to that object. References can point to objects or nothing at all (`null`).

```java
String jet = new String("My Private Jet");
String plane = jet; 
String anotherPlane = jet;
//How many objects do we have here?
// How many references do we have here?

```

---

# More on References in Java 

Changes are visible to all references 
```java
public class Student {
  String name = "akhila";
}
Student akhila = new Student();
Student akhi = akhila; // what is akhi.name? 
akhi.name = "akhi"; // what is akhila.name?

```
Pop Quiz: Does copying a reference copy the object? 

---

# More on Reference in Java 

```java
public class Student {
  private String value;
  public Student(String setValue) {
    value = setValue;
  }
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof Student)) {
      return false;
    }
    Student other = (Student) o;
    return value == other.value; 
  }
}
Student a = new Student("jackie");
Student b = new Student("jackie");
Student c = a;
System.out.println(a == b);       //`==` tests reference equality.
System.out.println(a.equals(b));  //`.equals()` tests instance equality.
System.out.println(a == c);
System.out.println(a.equals(c));
```

# Practice with References (5 minutes)

Create a method called `compareMovie()` that takes in two Movies. If the references to the two movie objects are the same, it should return a String "passedTest1". If the instances of the two objects match, return a String "passedTest2". Otherwise, return "failed".

---

# Starter Code 

```java
public class Movie {
  private String value;
  public Movie(String setValue) {
    value = setValue;
  }
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof Movie)) {
      return false;
    }
    Movie other = (Movie) o;
    return value == other.value; 
  }
  
  public static String compareMovie(Movie first, Movie second) { 
    // write your code here 
  }
}
```

# Java and Copying

**Problem**: Java has no *built-in* way to create a copy of a object (side note: `clone()` does exist, but it's not really recommended)

**Solution**: Use copy constructors! 

Copy Constructors - conventions or a pattern adopted by Java programmers over time to copy objects 

Shallow Copy - copy over references to the original object, but no new object is created...what does this mean???

Deep Copy - creates a whole new object that is a replica of the original 

```java
public class Movie(Movie m) {
  rating = m.rating;
  director = d.rating; 
}
```

# Practice with Shallow Copy (5 minutes)

Add a copy constructor to the Movie class to create a shallow copy of the passed in Movie argument. 

```java
public class Movie {
  private int generalRating; 
  public int getGeneralRating() {
    return generalRating; 
  }
  public Movie(int setGeneralRating) {
    generalRating = setGeneralRating;
  }

  //write your copy constructor here 
  
}
```
---
# Practice with Deep Copy (10 minutes)

Create a deep copy of the class below.

```java
public class Playlist {
  private String[] playlist; 
  
  public Playlist(String[] songs) {
    playlist = songs;
  }

  //write your copy constructor here
}

String[] songs = {"Dear John", "22", "cardigan"};
Playlist one = new Playlist(songs);
Playlist second = new Playlist(one);
```

---

# Yay! You made it to the end! 

Recap: 
- Upcasting is easy. Downcasting is a little more complex. 

- References point to the object. Like your address points to you. 

- With shallow copies, no new object is created. With deep copies, a new object is created. 

Have a good week. See you on Friday. Peace ✌️

# Practice with Upcasting and Downcasting

```java
class Movie {
  private int generalRating; 
  public int getGeneralRating() {

// new child class 
class International extends Movie {  
  private int language; 
  public int getLanguage() {
    return language;
  }
}

Movie parasite = new International();
if (parasite instanceof International) {
  International parasiteMovie = (International) parasite;
  parasiteMovie.getLanguage();

# Practice with Shallow Copy

```java
public class Movie {
  private int generalRating; 
  public int getGeneralRating() {
    return generalRating; 
  }
  public Movie(int setGeneralRating) {
    generalRating = setGeneralRating;

# Practice with Deep Copy

```java
  public Playlist(Playlist o) {
    playlist = new String[o.playlist.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < o.playlist.length; i++) {
      playlist[i] = o.playlist[i];
    } 
  }
```
