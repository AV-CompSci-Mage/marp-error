# "Hey you're pretty, can I get your reference?"

Remember, *references are not the objects* themselves. To prove it, use this line of code.

```java
Object o = new Object();
System.out.println(o);
```

Java will print out `java.lang.Object@<memory address>` which denotes the type, `java.lang.Object`, and it's location in memory.

*Any variable with the same reference will manipulate the same object.* New objects are only created through the `new` keyword.

---

# Objects vs. Primitives Mutability

*Mutability: The ability to change.*

*Objects are mutable*, i.e. they can change after they're declared.

On the other hand, *primitives* (`int`, `double`, `char`) *are immutable*. Instead, primitives (and `String`) are replaced whenever reassigned.

```java
int i = 5; // i stores 5.
i = 1; // 5 gets replaced by 1. 5 gets lost.

Pet myPet = new Pet("Josh"); // myPet stores a name containing "Josh".
myPet.name = "Justin";
// "Josh" gets replaced with "Justin", but the myPet is still the same.
```

---

# "Who cares about mutability?"

It'll help you understand how functions deal with objects vs. primitives. Consider below.

```java
void addOne(int i) { // takes a primitive.
  i++;
}

int age = 23;
addOne(age);
System.out.println(age); // still 23!

class Pet {
  String name;
  int age;

  Pet(String setName, int setAge) {
    this.name = setName;
    this.age = setAge;
  }
}

void addOne(Pet pet) {
  pet.age++;
}

Pet myPet = new Pet("Josh", 5); // .name and .age
addOne(myPet);
System.out.println(myPet.age); // it's now 6! (not factorial)
```

# Practice with Mutability (10 minutes)

*You just got hired by the TSA! Congrats!*

You need to write a program to stamp passports given a `Passport` and `ID` object.

You will stamp the passport only if the name and age on both match on both forms.

Because objects are mutable, make this a `void` function that will change the passport itself.

Print out `"Rejected!"` if they don't match, otherwise print `"Enjoy your flight!"`.

---

# Passport Stamping Starter Code

```java
class ID {
  String name;
  int age;

  ID(String setName, int setAge) {
    this.name = setName;
    this.age = setAge;
  }
}

class Passport extends ID {
  boolean stamped;

  Passport(String setName, int setAge) {
    super(setName, setAge);
  }
}

void stampPassport(Passport p, ID i) {
  // your code here.
}

Passport jackiePassport = new Passport("Jackie", 23);
ID jackieID = new ID("Jackie", 23);
ID strangerID = new ID("Josh", 27);

stampPassport(jackiePassport, jackieID); // should print "Enjoy your flight!"
System.out.println(jackiePassport.stamped); // should print "true".

stampPassport(jackiePassport, strangerID); // should print "Rejected!"
```

# Java Memory Management

Java is a pioneer in memory management. It has a feature called *automatic garbage collection* which removes the responsibility of deleting memory from you.

Java will delete objects/variables when there are no more references pointing to it.

This is a blessing that you'll soon appreciate more when you continue your computer science journeyâ€”talk to anyone who's taken a C/C++ course about `segfaults`.

# Questions On Memory (5 minutes)

1. New objects are created in memory *only* when `<keyword>` is found in code.

2. How big of a concern is memory for most instances of programming?

3. How do you think about memory? How do you imagine how memory works on a computer?

# "Don't reinvent the wheel dude." - Imports and Libraries

Let's say you want to program something that handles times. That's very annoying. You have to deal with multiple different timezones, formats (AM/PM, or 24 hour), daylight savings, conversions. Holy cow that's miserable. That's why you don't and import someone else's library.

More likely than not, someone has solved your problem more thoroughly than you. If it's available, use it and appreciate the fact that computer science is collaborative.

[Fascinating video](https://youtu.be/-5wpm-gesOY) about how annoying timezones is in programming!

---

# Some Java Libraries as Reminders
- `java.util.Random` gets you a (psuedo-)random number (harder than you think)!

- `java.util.Arrays` gets arrays with more functionality!

- `java.util.ArrayList` gets `ArrayList` objects from Java!

- `java.math` gets amazing math functions (e.g. exponents, sin/cos/tan, logs)!

---

# Practice with Libraries (30 minutes)

We'll use `java.util.ArrayList` and `java.util.Random`.

We'll make a `ArrayList` of Marbles and use a variety of functions in provided by `ArrayList`.

- Implement a function called `void printBag(ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles)` that prints out all the marbles in the bag. (10 minutes)

- Implement a function called `void addAll(ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles, Marbles[] marbles)` to add all `Marble` objects in an array into the `ArrayList`. (10 minutes)

- Implement a function called `Marble pickRandom(ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles)` that will return a random, removed `Marble` from the given bag. (10 minutes)

[ArrayList documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html) and [Random documenation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html).

# Marbles Starter Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
// import java.util.Random;

class Marble {
  String color;
  int radius;
  
  Marble(String setColor, int setRadius) {
    this.color = setColor;
    this.radius = setRadius;
  }
}

ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles = new ArrayList<Marble>();
bagOfMarbles.add(new Marble("Red", 1));
bagOfMarbles.add(new Marble("Red", 1));
```

# That's it for today!

I didn't get to serialization today, but we'll touch more on it later I'm sure.

Hopefully these problems give you a better idea of how references work and how Java handles them differently than primitives.

Have a safe and fun weekend! Do something fun.

# Passport Stamping Solution

```java
void stampPassport(Passport p, ID i) {
  if (p.name.equals(i.name) && p.age == i.age) {
    System.out.println("Enjoy your flight!");
    p.stamped = true;
  } else {
    System.out.println("Rejected!");
  }

  return;
}
```

# Memory Answers

1. New objects are created in memory only when the `new` keyword is present.

2. Memory shouldn't be a huge concern to most programmers. Exceptions include very low-powered devices or when performance is critical (like very critical). I don't consider it usually, I prioritize readability more.

3. Memory, to me, is a long string of 1s and 0s that get allocated to you by a programming language/operating system (something you don't really need to consider). Whatever those 1s and 0s represent depends on context, but dividing up that memory for programs isn't something you need to consider as the programming languages/operating systems you're working with handle it.

# Marbles Solution

```java
void printBag(ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles) {
  int size = bagOfMarbles.size();
  
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    Marble m = bagOfMarbles.get(i);
    System.out.println(m.color + " marble, size: " + m.radius);
  }
  
  return;
}

```

---

# Marbles Solution (Cont.)

```java
void addAll(ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles, Marble[] marbles) {
  for (int i = 0; i < marbles.length; i++) {
    bagOfMarbles.add(marbles[i]);
  }
  
  return;
}
```
---

# Marbles Solution (Cont.)

```java
Marble removeRandom(ArrayList<Marble> bagOfMarbles) {
  Random rand = new Random();
  int randomIndex = rand.nextInt(bagOfMarbles.size());
  
  Marble m = bagOfMarbles.get(randomIndex);
  bagOfMarbles.remove(randomIndex);
  
  return m;
}
```
