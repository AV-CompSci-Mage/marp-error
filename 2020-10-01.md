# 2 Calendar Update

Thusday's CDT section will now start at 5 to match the sceduled course time (banner) 

* Eastern timezone sessions, and Tuesdays will continue at sceduled times

* Make sure to keep up with the calendar for links and timings

---

# Format

* 3 practice problems every session

* focused on practical understanding of concepts covered recently in class

* slides and material available after class

--- 

# How to follow along

* Small breakout rooms of working together 

* Work for 10-15 minutes together, feel free to use paper, whiteboards, online share tools.

* Use the `jeed` playground on the 125 homepage for the interactive running

---

# This

* always refers to the current instance that is executing the method
* in the example below `this` is used to distinguish name(the instance variable), and name(the method param)
* checkstyle is your friend

```java
public class Dog {

  private String name;

  Dog(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

---
# Static

* Attaching the `static` keyword to attach the method to the class, rather than the instance
* `static` class methods cannot access instance variables

```java
public class Building {
  private String name;
  private int height;
  public Building(String name, int height) {
    this.name = name;
    this.height = height;
  }
  public static String getName() {
    return name;
  }
}
Building student = new Building("Siebel", 4);
// Will this work? why/why not?
System.out.println(student.getName());
```
---
# Final

* keyword disallows a variable from being modified
* Perfect for constants
---

# 1) Inheritance

* Inheritance can be useful when we have objects that share functionality
* ```class SubClass extends BaseClass```
* class Chuchu extends Pet

---

# Inheritance Example
* what do you think happens here?

```java
public class Animal {
    public Animal(){
        System.out.println("New animal created!");
    }
}
public class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(){
        System.out.println("New cat created!");
    }
}
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Animal c1 = new Cat();
    }
}
```
---

# Inheritance Example
* What gets printed here? 

```java
class Base {
    final public void show() {
       System.out.println("Base::show() called");
    }
}
  
class Derived extends Base {
    public void show() {
       System.out.println("Derived::show() called");
    }
}
  
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Base b = new Derived();;
        b.show();
    }
}
```
---

# Private/Protected
* ```Private``` variables in the parent class can't be accessed by child classes
* Child classes can acess ```protected``` variables in the parent class
---

# Super
* the `super` keyword is used in the child constructor to call the parent constructor
``` Java
public class Animal {
    protected String name;
    protected String sound;
    public Animal(String n, String s){
        name = n; 
        sound = s; 
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
   public double cutenessLevel; 
   protected boolean hasClaws; 
}
```
---

---
# Exersize #1 (10 miniutes)
* using the sample code in the previous slide, create a constructor in the Cat class using `super`
* What other vaiables could fit in the class structure?
---

# Exersize #2 (10 miniutes)

* Create a class named ```Rectangle``` containting (doubles) ```length``` and ```width```. Then create two methods to print the area and perimeter. 

* Let class ```'Square'``` inherit ```Rectangle``` with its constructor having a parameter for its side (suppose s), and call the constructor of its parent class as 'super(s,s)'. 
---

---
# Exersize #2 Starter Code
```Java
Class Rectangle{
  int length;
  int breadth;

// don't forget Your constructor!
  public void findArea(){
    // code here
  }
  public void findPerimeter() {
    //code here
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle{
  // code here
  // don't forget Your constructor!
}
```

# Polymorphisim
* polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types
---

---
# "Is a" vs 
* polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types
    * every instance of any Java class "is a" Object
    * Dogs are (Pets are (Animals are Objects))

---

# polymorphism example
* Say we have a class Animal with the function speak()
* Say we have class Cat that extends Animal, with a function meow()
* Which method(s) can be called on a Cat object? Which can be called on an Animal?
---

# Upcasting vs Downcasting
* Upcasting means we are taking a child object and casting it up, as the parent object
    * ie) casting `Object Cat` as an `Object Animal`
* Downcasting means the opposite, taking a parent object, and casting it as a child
    * ie) Animal myAnimal = new Cat();
    * NOTE: if we aren't careful, we can ClassCastException
    * the compiler is your BFF
---

# Exersize 3, ordering off the kids menu
### Fix the following upcast:

```Java
Class Person{
    int age;
    Person(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
Class Child extends Person{
    int age;
    boolean kid;
    Child(int age, boolean kid) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

```
Thanks for coming!!!
