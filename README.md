# CS 199 Even More Practice

Slides for CS 199 Even More Practice Using [Marp](https://marp.app/).

The `html` files are generated from the `markdown` files, don't try to edit those directly.

You can find the [homepage](https://cs199emp.netlify.app/) here.

Pull Requests welcome.

## Contributing

1. `git pull` - Load up whatever's done so far. Sometimes this will include autogenerated slide files in the `dist/` folder.

2. The `slides/` folder has the slides in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, make sure to create/edit the right one. `template.md` can be a good starting point.

3. Make sure `index.html` has a link to `/dist/YYYY-MD-DD.html`. It's fine if the file doesn't exist yet (it will be autogenerated) just make sure to include it so that viewers can actually see it.

## Locally Using marp

If you want to do this you can, but the CI will automatically take care of it so you don't have to.

1. Install it (assuming you have `npm`)

```bash
npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli
```

2. To convert
```bash
marp -I slides/ --output dist/
```
